# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets with Naive Bayes
University assignment. All coments in the notebook are in Spanish.

## Key Features
- **Task:** This notebook focuses on the task of sentiment analysis, a natural language processing (NLP) classification problem.
- **Dataset:** The notebook uses a dataset of tweets, which have been pre-labeled with sentiment categories (e.g., fear, surprise, love).
- **Analysis:** You'll find an in-depth exploration of the dataset, including statistics, visualizations, and insights into tweet sentiment distribution.
- **Data Cleaning:** Data preprocessing steps are included to clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
- **Model:** Naive Bayes, a classic machine learning algorithm for text classification, is implemented for sentiment analysis.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance metrics are computed and visualized to assess how well Naive Bayes classifies tweet sentiments.
- **Reproducibility:** The notebook includes Python code and detailed explanations, making it easy to replicate the analysis and results.
